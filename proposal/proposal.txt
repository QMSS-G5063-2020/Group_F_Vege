A website collects vegetarian recipes. Probably need web scrapping to get the data. But the web pages are not in a consistent format. 
- BudgetByte.com 
https://www.budgetbytes.com/category/recipes/
This is a recipe website; it has vegetarian and vegan categories. We can try web scrapping it.

We may have data from different years, would that be a problem? For example, the customer preference dataset is from 2018 but the restaurant dataset is from 2019.
